Why this project exists? (Yes, I was asked this questions MANY times)

Putting aside fun part of coding a virtual machine, the goal is
to create learning environment for students in software engineering.

Below is not 100% set...

Topics to be covered in learning materials vary from python and java to
common algorithms and implementations. The main idea is to give students
a context, when they can implement specific feature (e.g. bitwise shift)
and see a result (versus coding small program out of context, like read
an array, sort it and print it to the screen - no fun)

Here is sample list:

 - python language
 - common tools for python (e.g. how to test)
 - java + basic tools
 - java lang specification
 - source code management
 - java virtual machine specification
 - class loading process
 - garbage collection
 - java memory model
 - bitwise operations
 - float/double numbers
 - big/little endian systems
 - ???

Feel free to add other stuff right under and push back to github
